## Project Overview

### Description:
Dotluck is a lottery platform where users can test their luck by betting on multiple types of lottery games built on top of the Polkadot blockchain. Polkadot provides a multi-layered security structure, ensuring that the system operates in a trustless environment. 

The platform features two main types of lottery games:
1. **High-Risk, High-Reward Lottery**: Users can purchase tickets from $1 to $10 and stand a chance to win a substantial reward from the pool.
2. **No-Loss Lottery**: Users buy a ticket for the lottery pool and, if they don’t win, they can opt-out and get their original amount back, providing a risk-free option. Additionally, choosing to stay in the lottery increases their chances of winning in the raffle.

### Key Features:
- **Lottery**: High Risk, High Reward. Users can purchase tickets for a modest price and have a chance to win large rewards.
- **No Loss Lottery**: Users can play risk-free by receiving their original stake back if they don’t win while staying in the game increases their chance of winning.
